‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ base.py              (Abstract base class)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ factory.py           (Source factory)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ usa_swimming.py      (Existing, refactored)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ aia_arizona.py       (NEW - High schools)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ canonical.py         (Unified data model)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ *.py                 (Source-agnostic)
```

### Configuration

```bash
# .env for different sources
DATA_SOURCE="usa_swimming"  # or "aia_arizona"

# USA Swimming config
USA_SWIMMING_TEAM_CODE="RAYS"

# AIA Arizona config  
AIA_SCHOOL_NAME="Desert Vista High School"
AIA_DIVISION="I"
```

- Create AIA source implementation
- **Deliverable:** Multi-source architecture working

### Phase 3: Athletic.net Integration - 2-3 weeks

- Build web scraper
- Merge with state championship data
- **Deliverable:** More comprehensive high school data

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation - 1 week
- Test with real high schools
- Validate against official records
- Document privacy procedures
- **Deliverable:** Production-ready AIA support

**Total Estimate:** 2-3 months for full implementation

## üöß Challenges Identified

### Technical
1. **PDF Parsing:** Text-based, not table-structured (harder to parse)
2. **No Unique IDs:** Students identified by name+school+year only
3. **Format Variations:** May differ between years (2001 vs 2024)
4. **Limited Data:** State championships only, no regular season

### Privacy
1. **FERPA Compliance:** High school students have special protections
2. **Minors:** Most swimmers are 14-18 years old
3. **Parental Consent:** May be required for some uses
4. **Opt-Out:** Need mechanism for removal requests

### Data Quality
1. **Incomplete Coverage:** Missing dual meets, invitationals, sections
2. **Qualifiers Only:** Only fastest swimmers make state
3. **Graduation:** Students leave system after 4 years
4. **Name Collisions:** Multiple students with same name

## üí° Key Insights

### 1. Feasibility: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (4/5)
AIA integration is **feasible but challenging**. The data exists and is publicly available, but requires significant parsing work.

### 2. Value Proposition
- **High school teams:** Can track team records
- **Club swimmers:** Can combine club + high school times
- **State analysis:** Trends across Arizona swimming
- **Recruiting:** Historical performance data

### 3. Recommended Approach
Start with **state championships only** (MVP), then expand to Athletic.net for completeness. Focus on recent years (2015-2024) initially.

### 4. Privacy First
Build with privacy in mind from the start:
- Public data only
- No PII collection
- Opt-out mechanism
- Age off after graduation

---

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. Build regex-based PDF parser
2. Extract one event from 2024 PDF
3. Validate against source PDF
4. Test with multiple years

### Short Term (Next Week)
1. Parse all events from 2024
2. Build AIA database schema
3. Extract 2020-2024 data
4. Design abstract source interface

### Medium Term (Next Month)
1. Implement multi-source architecture
2. Refactor USA Swimming to plugin
3. Create AIA source plugin
4. Test with sample high school

## üìà Success Metrics

To consider AIA integration successful:

- [ ] Parse 2024 state championships (>90% accuracy)
- [ ] Handle format variations (2015, 2020, 2024)
- [ ] Extract 10+ years of data (2015-2024)
- [ ] Generate records for test high school
- [ ] Multi-source architecture working
- [ ] Privacy procedures documented

## ü§î Open Questions

1. **Athletic.net ToS:** Can we scrape? Need to review terms
2. **Historical backfill:** Parse all 24 years or start at 2015?
3. **Division structure:** How to handle D1/D2 vs D1/D2/D3 changes?
4. **Name collisions:** How to disambiguate "John Smith" at different schools?
5. **Privacy age-off:** Keep data for how many years after graduation?

---

## üí∞ Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Costs
- **Development:** 2-3 months (50-100 hours)
- **Maintenance:** PDF format changes, privacy requests
- **Complexity:** Multi-source architecture overhead

### Benefits  
- **New use case:** High school teams can use tool
- **Market expansion:** Arizona has ~50+ high schools with swim programs
- **Data richness:** Club swimmers get complete picture
- **Differentiation:** No other tools combine club + HS data

### Verdict
**Worth pursuing** if targeting Arizona high school market. **Skip** if only focused on club swimming.

## üîó Related Work

### Similar Projects
- **Milesplit** - Track & field results (successful model)
- **MaxPreps** - Multi-sport high school stats
- **DyeStatCal** - XC results (volunteer-maintained)

### Lessons Learned
1. **PDF parsing is hard** - Allow extra time for format variations
2. **Privacy matters** - Build opt-out from start
3. **Community-driven** - Volunteers help maintain data
4. **Start narrow** - One state/region first, then expand

---

## üìû Stakeholder Input Needed

Before proceeding, consider getting input from:

1. **High school coaches** - Would they use this? What features needed?
2. **AIA** - Are they OK with us parsing their PDFs?
3. **Legal review** - Is our privacy approach sufficient?
4. **Athletic.net** - Can we partner instead of scrape?

---

## ‚úÖ Session Complete

**Status:** Research phase complete, ready for prototype implementation

**Recommendation:** 
1. Build PDF parser prototype (1-2 days)
2. Test with 2024 data
3. If successful, proceed with full implementation
4. If too difficult, pivot to Athletic.net only

**Next Chat:**
"Let's build a PDF parser for the 2024 AIA state championships. Start with extracting one event (50 Free Division I boys) and validate accuracy."
