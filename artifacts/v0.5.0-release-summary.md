## What's New

### 1. Top 10 All-Time Lists (`generate top10`)

Generate ranked lists of top performers for each event.

**Command:**
```bash
swim-data-tool generate top10 [--course=scy|lcm|scm] [--n=10]
```

**Features:**
- Top N performers across ALL age groups (default: 10)

- Separate markdown file per event
- Saves to `data/records/top10/{course}/{event}.md`
- Customizable N with `--n` flag
- Probationary swim indicators (‡)
- Rich progress output

**Example Output:**
```markdown
# Team Name
## 50 Freestyle - All-Time Top 10
### Short Course Yards (SCY)

| Rank | Time | Athlete | Age | Date | Meet |
|------|------|---------|-----|------|------|
| 1 | 19.99 | John Doe | 18 | 2023-12-15 | Winter Nationals |
| 2 | 20.12 | Jane Smith | 17 | 2024-02-18 | Sectionals |
...
```

### 2. Annual Season Summaries (`generate annual`)

Generate season-specific summaries with new record tracking.

**Command:**
```bash
swim-data-tool generate annual --season=2024 [--course=scy|lcm|scm]
```

**Features:**
- Season-specific best times
- Compares against all-time records
- Highlights new records set
- Best times by age group
- Saves to `data/records/annual/{year}-{course}.md`
- Rich formatted output

**Example Output:**
```markdown
# Team Name
## 2024 Season Summary
### Short Course Yards (SCY)

## 🏆 New Team Records Set

- **50 Freestyle, Boys 13-14**: 21.45 by John Doe (previous: 21.89)
- **100 Back, Girls 15-16**: 54.32 by Jane Smith (previous: 55.12)

## Best Times of the Season

### Boys 13-14
| Event | Time | Athlete | Age | Date | Meet |
...
```

### 3. Publish Command (`publish`)

Publish records to public GitHub repository.

**Command:**
```bash
swim-data-tool publish [--dry-run]
```

**Features:**
- Clones/pulls public repository
- Copies all markdown files from `data/records/`
- Commits with timestamp
- Pushes to GitHub
- Dry-run mode for testing
- Requires git and SSH keys
- Configuration via .env

**Configuration:**
```bash
# Add to .env
PUBLIC_REPO_URL="https://github.com/username/team-records.git"
PUBLIC_REPO_LOCAL="/tmp/team-records"
```

**Workflow:**
1. Checks configuration
2. Clones repo (if not exists) or pulls latest
3. Copies records to public repo
4. Commits changes with timestamp
5. Pushes to GitHub
6. Shows public URL

---

## Complete Workflow

The full workflow is now complete:

```bash
# 1. Initialize team
swim-data-tool init "Team Name"

# 2. Fetch roster
swim-data-tool roster --seasons=all

# 3. Import swimmers
swim-data-tool import swimmers

# 4. Classify swims
swim-data-tool classify unattached

# 5. Generate records
swim-data-tool generate records

# 6. Generate top 10 lists
swim-data-tool generate top10

# 7. Generate annual summaries
swim-data-tool generate annual --season=2024

# 8. Publish to GitHub
swim-data-tool publish
```

## Usage Examples

### Top 10 Lists

```bash
# Generate for all courses
swim-data-tool generate top10

# Generate for SCY only
swim-data-tool generate top10 --course=scy

# Generate top 25 instead of top 10
swim-data-tool generate top10 --n=25
```

### Annual Summaries

```bash
# Generate for 2024 season (all courses)
swim-data-tool generate annual --season=2024

# Generate for specific course
swim-data-tool generate annual --season=2024 --course=scy

# Generate for multiple years
swim-data-tool generate annual --season=2023
swim-data-tool generate annual --season=2024
swim-data-tool generate annual --season=2025
```

### Publishing

```bash
# Dry run (preview)
swim-data-tool publish --dry-run

# Actually publish
swim-data-tool publish
```

---

## Breaking Changes

None! All existing commands continue to work as before.

---

## Migration Guide

No migration needed. Just update to v0.5.0 and the new commands will be available.

**To use publish:**
1. Add PUBLIC_REPO_URL and PUBLIC_REPO_LOCAL to your .env
2. Ensure git is installed
3. Configure SSH keys for GitHub
4. Run `swim-data-tool publish --dry-run` to test
5. Run `swim-data-tool publish` to publish

---

## Known Limitations

- Publish requires git installation and SSH keys
- Annual summaries use calendar year (Jan-Dec)
  - Future: Add season configuration (e.g., Sep-Aug for SCY)
- Top 10 lists are across all age groups
  - Future: Add age group filtering option
- No relay events yet
  - Future: Add relay recognition and individual crediting

---

## Next Steps (Future Versions)

### v0.6.0 (Future)
- Relay recognition and individual swimmer crediting
- Enhanced season configuration (non-calendar year seasons)
- Age group filtering for top 10 lists
- World Aquatics integration
- Performance optimizations

### v1.0.0 (Future)
- First stable release
- Full test coverage
- Comprehensive documentation
- Example workflows and tutorials

---

## Testing

All commands have been implemented and are ready for testing.

**Recommended test approach:**
1. Generate records (from v0.4.0): `swim-data-tool generate records`
2. Generate top 10: `swim-data-tool generate top10 --course=scy`
3. Generate annual: `swim-data-tool generate annual --season=2024`
4. Test publish: `swim-data-tool publish --dry-run`
