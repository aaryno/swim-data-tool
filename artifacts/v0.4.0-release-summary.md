# v0.4.0 Release Summary - Generate Records Command

**Release Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Released and Pushed to GitHub

---

## Overview

v0.4.0 introduces the **generate records** command - the core feature that transforms raw swim data into beautiful, organized team records by course and age group.

This is the "crown jewel" feature that makes swim-data-tool truly useful for swim teams!

---

## What's New

### üéØ Generate Records Command

```bash
# Generate records for all courses
swim-data-tool generate records

# Generate records for specific course
swim-data-tool generate records --course=scy
swim-data-tool generate records --course=lcm
swim-data-tool generate records --course=scm
```

**Features:**
- Reads swimmer data from `data/raw/swimmers/`
- Includes probationary swims from classification
- Filters for team-affiliated swims based on configured team names
- Groups by course (SCY, LCM, SCM), age group (10U, 11-12, 13-14, 15-16, 17-18, Open), and event
- Finds best time per swimmer for each category
- Generates markdown files with formatted tables
- Adds indicators for probationary swims (‚Ä°)
- Saves to `data/records/{course}/records.md`

### üìä Event Definitions Module

**File:** `src/swim_data_tool/models/events.py`

**Features:**
- Complete event lists for SCY (18 events), LCM (16 events), SCM (16 events)
- Age group definitions (10U, 11-12, 13-14, 15-16, 17-18, Open)
- Event parsing utilities:
  - `parse_api_event()` - Parse "50 FR SCY" format
  - `create_event_code()` - Generate "50-free" codes
  - `format_event_name()` - Format display names
- Time conversion:
  - `convert_time_to_seconds()` - Convert "1:42.15" to seconds
- Age group determination:
  - `determine_age_group()` - Map age to category

### ‚öôÔ∏è Record Generation Service

**File:** `src/swim_data_tool/services/record_generator.py`

**Features:**
- `RecordEntry` dataclass for structured record data
- `RecordGenerator` class with methods:
  - `load_all_swimmer_data()` - Load from raw directory
  - `load_probationary_data()` - Load from processed directory
  - `filter_team_swims()` - Filter by team names
  - `parse_and_normalize_events()` - Parse events, convert times, determine age groups
  - `get_best_times_by_event()` - Calculate records by course/age/event
  - `generate_records_markdown()` - Create formatted markdown output

## Example Output

### Generated File Structure

```
data/records/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scy/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ records.md       # Short Course Yards records
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lcm/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ records.md       # Long Course Meters records
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scm/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ records.md       # Short Course Meters records
```

### Sample Record Table

```markdown
### 50 Freestyle

| Age Group | Time | Athlete | Age | Date | Meet |
|-----------|------|---------|-----|------|------|
| 10U | 26.45 | John Doe | 10 | 2024-03-15 | West Championships |
| 11-12 | 24.12 | Jane Smith ‚Ä° | 12 | 2023-02-22 | State Meet |
| 13-14 | 21.89 | Bob Johnson | 14 | 2024-03-01 | Sectionals |
| 15-16 | 20.45 | Alice Williams | 16 | 2024-02-18 | Regionals |
| 17-18 | 19.99 | Mike Brown | 18 | 2023-12-15 | Winter Nationals |
| Open | 19.99 | Mike Brown | 18 | 2023-12-15 | Winter Nationals |
```

**Legend:**
- ‚Ä° = Probationary period (before joining team)

## Technical Implementation

### Event Parsing

Events from the USA Swimming API come as:
- "50 FR SCY"
- "100 BACK LCM"
- "200 IM SCY"

These are parsed into:
- Distance: "50", "100", "200"
- Stroke: "free", "back", "breast", "fly", "im"
- Course: "scy", "lcm", "scm"

And normalized to event codes:
- "50-free"
- "100-back"
- "200-im"

### Age Group Logic

| Age | Age Group |
|-----|-----------|
| ‚â§10 | 10U |
| 11-12 | 11-12 |
| 13-14 | 13-14 |
| 15-16 | 15-16 |
| 17-18 | 17-18 |
| 19+ | Open |

Open category includes all ages.

### Best Time Calculation

1. Load swimmer data from raw and processed directories
2. Filter for team swims (match configured team names)
3. Parse events and convert times to seconds
4. Group by course, age group, and event
5. For each swimmer, keep only their best time
6. Select the overall best time across all swimmers

## Testing Notes

**Not tested yet** - The API client is not being exercised until later to avoid hitting the USA Swimming API during development.

When ready to test:
1. Use the session summary from `artifacts/session-summary-v0.1-v0.3.md`
2. Initialize a test team
3. Import a small set of swimmers (5-10)
4. Classify unattached swims
5. Generate records
6. Verify markdown output

## Code Quality

- ‚úÖ No linting errors (ruff)
- ‚úÖ No type errors (mypy)
- ‚úÖ All existing tests passing
- ‚è≠Ô∏è New tests for record generation (future)
