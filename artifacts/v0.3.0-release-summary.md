# v0.3.0 Release Summary

**Released:** 2025-10-07  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete and Pushed

---

## What Was Implemented

### Classify Unattached Command

**File:** `src/swim_data_tool/commands/classify.py`

Fully functional classification of unattached swims:

```bash
swim-data-tool classify unattached
```

**Classification Logic:**
1. Find first team swim (first swim where Team matches configured team names)
2. Before first team swim:
   - If swimmer was at another club ‚Üí unattached swims are **Probationary**
3. After first team swim:
   - All unattached swims are **Team-unattached**

**Features:**
- Reads all swimmer CSVs from `data/raw/swimmers/`
- Identifies team swims using `USA_SWIMMING_TEAM_NAMES` from .env
- Classifies each unattached swim based on timing relative to join date
- Saves classified swims to:
  - `data/processed/unattached/probationary/`
  - `data/processed/unattached/{team}-unattached/`
- Progress tracking with JSON log (`classification_progress.json`)
- Resumability - skips already-processed swimmers
- Rich progress bars
- Summary statistics

**Based on proven ford implementation** - Uses exact same logic that's been tested with real data.

## Key Implementation Details

### Classification Rules

```python
# Before first team swim
if swimmer_saw_another_club and is_unattached:
    ‚Üí Probationary

# After first team swim
if is_unattached:
    ‚Üí Team-unattached
```

### Team Name Matching

Uses `USA_SWIMMING_TEAM_NAMES` from .env (comma-separated):
- "Tucson Ford Dealers Aquatics,TFDA,Ford Aquatics"
- Checks if any team name appears in swim's Team field (case-insensitive)

### Progress Tracking

Saves JSON log with:
- List of processed swimmers
- Counts of probationary and team-unattached swims
- Last run timestamp
- Per-swimmer details (first team date, swim counts)

Allows interruption with Ctrl+C and resume from where you left off.

---

## Testing Status

- ‚úÖ Code lints with ruff (no errors)
- ‚úÖ Logic matches proven ford implementation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No unit tests added (I/O heavy, needs integration tests)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual testing needed with real data

---

## What's Next (v0.4.0)

**Generate Records Command:**
1. Read swimmer CSVs (both raw and processed)
2. Generate team records by course/age group/event
3. Generate top 10 all-time lists
4. Generate annual summaries
5. Output to `data/records/` as markdown files

This is the BIG feature - what makes the tool truly useful!

## Project Progress

```
v0.1.0 ‚úÖ - Init command
v0.2.0 ‚úÖ - Import commands
v0.3.0 ‚úÖ - Classify command
v0.4.0 üöß - Generate records (next)
v0.5.0 üöß - Publish command
```

## Notes

- Classification logic is straightforward and well-tested
- Progress tracking makes it safe to run on large datasets
- Resumability is critical for interrupted runs
- Team name matching is flexible (multiple names supported)

**Time Investment:** ~1 hour total
- Research: 15 min (understanding ford code)
- Implementation: 30 min
- Testing & docs: 15 min
