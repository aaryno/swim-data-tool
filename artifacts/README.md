# artifacts/

This directory contains AI-generated documentation, task lists, and working artifacts for the swim-data-tool project.

## Purpose

The `artifacts/` directory serves as a workspace for:
- Development task lists and TODO tracking
- Design documents and Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Feature planning and implementation notes
- Research documents and analysis
- Migration plans and upgrade guides
- Any temporary or working documentation

## Why This Directory?

To keep the project root clean and organized, AI assistants place all working documents here rather than cluttering the root directory with markdown files.

## Guidelines

- Use descriptive kebab-case filenames (e.g., `task-list-v0.2.0.md`)
- Date documents when relevant
- Clean up outdated artifacts periodically
- Move important documents to `docs/` when they become permanent

## Current Artifacts

None yet - this directory was created with v0.1.0 release.
