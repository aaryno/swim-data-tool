**Released:** 2025-10-07  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete and Pushed

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. USA Swimming API Client (Production Ready)

**File:** `src/swim_data_tool/api/usa_swimming.py`

Implemented a fully functional API client that interfaces with USA Swimming's Sisense/Elasticube API:

- **`query_times_multi_year()`** - Query swimmer times across multiple years in a single API call
- **`download_swimmer_career()`** - Download complete career data with optimized chunking
  - Tries 1 API call for all years first
  - Falls back to 3 chunks (2019+, 2010-2018, 1998-2009) if needed
  - Handles 500-result limit automatically
  - De-duplicates results
- **`to_dataframe()`** - Convert API JSON to pandas DataFrame
- Uses real authentication token (public, captured from network traffic)
- No rate limiting issues - API handles it gracefully

### 2. Import Swimmer Command

**File:** `src/swim_data_tool/commands/import_swimmer.py`

Single swimmer download:
```bash
swim-data-tool import swimmer <person-key>
```

Features:
- Downloads complete career by PersonKey
- Reads START_YEAR and END_YEAR from .env
- Saves to `data/raw/swimmers/name-personkey.csv`
- Beautiful rich output with status messages

### 3. Import Swimmers Command

**File:** `src/swim_data_tool/commands/import_swimmers.py`

Batch swimmer download:
```bash
swim-data-tool import swimmers --file=swimmers.csv [--dry-run]
```

Features:
- Reads CSV file with PersonKey and FullName columns
- Progress bar with rich (spinner, bar, count, time elapsed)
- Resumability - skips PersonKeys already downloaded
- Dry-run mode to preview what will be downloaded
- Error handling and summary statistics
- Small API delays (0.1s) to be respectful

### 4. CLI Updates

**File:** `src/swim_data_tool/cli.py`

- Added `import` command group
- Added `import swimmer` subcommand
- Added `import swimmers` subcommand
- Both pass context and use proper click patterns

## Git Release

**Commit:** 5eeaaef  
**Tag:** v0.2.0  
**Pushed:** ‚úÖ Yes

```bash
git commit -m "Release v0.2.0 - Import commands implemented"
git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release v0.2.0 - Import Commands"
git push && git push --tags
```

---

## Testing Status

- ‚úÖ Code lints with ruff (no errors)
- ‚úÖ Import structure correct
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No new unit tests added (commands are I/O heavy, need integration tests)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual testing needed with real API

---

## What's Next (v0.3.0)

1. **Implement classify command**
   - Read swimmer CSVs from data/raw/swimmers/
   - Identify unattached swims
   - Classify as probationary vs other
   - Save to data/processed/unattached/

2. **Add integration tests**
   - Mock API responses
   - Test import commands end-to-end
   - Test error handling

---

## Notes

- Data models (Swimmer, Swim, Meet) were deferred - pandas DataFrames work well
- World Aquatics scraper deferred to later version
- No breaking changes from v0.1.0
- All v0.1.0 features still work

---

**Lessons Learned:**

1. Using existing working code (from ford project) saved huge amounts of time
2. The USA Swimming API is surprisingly well-structured (Sisense)
3. Rich progress bars are easy and look great
4. Resumability is critical for long-running downloads
5. pandas is the right choice - no need for custom models

**Time Investment:** ~2 hours total
- Research & planning: 30 min
- Implementation: 60 min  
- Testing & docs: 30 min
