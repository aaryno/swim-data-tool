# Chat Summary - v0.6.0 Gender Support Implementation

## Context
I'm working on `swim-data-tool` (Python CLI for swim team records). We identified that generated records were combining boys/girls times, which violates USA Swimming standards.

## What We Completed (v0.6.0)

### Implementation
**1. Added Gender Lookup to API** (`src/swim_data_tool/api/usa_swimming.py`)
- Added `get_gender_for_persons()` method that batches PersonKeys (50 at a time)
- Queries USA Swimming's "Public Person Search" datasource for gender (M/F)

**2. Updated Roster Command** (`src/swim_data_tool/commands/roster.py`)
- Now calls `get_gender_for_persons()` after fetching roster
- Adds Gender column to roster CSV output
- Displays gender statistics (e.g., "385 males, 387 females")
- Shows gender in preview table

**3. Updated Import Swimmers** (`src/swim_data_tool/commands/import_swimmers.py`)
- Reads Gender column from roster CSV
- Creates gender_map and adds Gender column to each downloaded swimmer CSV

**4. Updated Record Generator** (`src/swim_data_tool/services/record_generator.py`)
- Added `filter_by_gender(df, gender)` method

**5. Updated All Generate Commands** (`src/swim_data_tool/commands/generate.py`)
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: All three commands now split by gender
- `generate records` → creates `records-boys.md` and `records-girls.md`
- `generate top10` → creates `top10/{course}/boys/` and `top10/{course}/girls/` directories
- `generate annual` → creates `{year}-{course}-boys.md` and `{year}-{course}-girls.md`
- Backwards compatible: falls back to combined records if no Gender column

**6. Updated Documentation**
- `VERSION` → 0.6.0
- `pyproject.toml` → version 0.6.0
- `CHANGELOG.md` → added v0.6.0 entry with breaking changes
- `claude.md` → updated version and history
- Created `artifacts/v0.6.0-release-summary.md`

### Testing
- All linting passed (`ruff check --fix`)
- All tests passed (`pytest`)
- No type errors (`mypy`)

## What Needs To Be Done

**Git commands need to be run manually** (terminal command execution had issues):

```bash
cd /Users/aaryn/swimming/swim-data-tool

git add .

git commit -m "Release v0.6.0: Gender support across all commands

- Add USASwimmingAPI.get_gender_for_persons() for batch gender lookup
- Update roster command to fetch gender for all swimmers
- Update import_swimmers to preserve Gender column in CSVs
- Add RecordGenerator.filter_by_gender() method
- BREAKING: generate records now creates separate boys/girls files
- BREAKING: generate top10 creates separate boys/girls directories
- BREAKING: generate annual creates separate boys/girls summaries
- Backwards compatible with missing gender data (falls back to combined)
- Display gender statistics in all command outputs
- Update documentation and create release artifact"

git tag -a v0.6.0 -m "Version 0.6.0 - Gender Support"

git push origin main --tags
```

## Usage for Existing Teams

To get gender-split records for an existing team like `south-west-aquatic-sports`:

```bash
cd /Users/aaryn/swimming/south-west-aquatic-sports

# Step 1: Re-fetch roster with gender
swim-data-tool roster --seasons=all

# Step 2: Re-import swimmers (adds Gender column to CSVs)
swim-data-tool import swimmers

# Step 3: Regenerate records (now creates separate boys/girls files)
swim-data-tool generate records
```

## Current Status
- ✅ All code changes complete
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ⏳ Need to run git commands manually to complete release
- ⏳ Need to test on actual team data (south-west-aquatic-sports)

## Key Files Changed

### Core Implementation
- `src/swim_data_tool/api/usa_swimming.py` - Added `get_gender_for_persons()`
- `src/swim_data_tool/commands/roster.py` - Gender fetch and display
- `src/swim_data_tool/commands/import_swimmers.py` - Gender preservation
- `src/swim_data_tool/services/record_generator.py` - Added `filter_by_gender()`
- `src/swim_data_tool/commands/generate.py` - Gender-split logic for all 3 commands

### Documentation
- `VERSION` → 0.6.0
- `pyproject.toml` → version 0.6.0
- `CHANGELOG.md` → Added v0.6.0 section with breaking changes notice
- `claude.md` → Updated current version and version history
- `artifacts/v0.6.0-release-summary.md` - Detailed release notes
- `artifacts/v0.6.0-implementation-summary.md` - This file

## Technical Details

### Gender Lookup Implementation
The `get_gender_for_persons()` method:
- Processes PersonKeys in batches of 50 (to avoid API limits)
- Uses "Public Person Search" datasource
- Returns dict mapping PersonKey → "M" or "F"
- Handles API errors gracefully (continues with next batch)

### Breaking Changes - File Structure

**Before (v0.5.x):**
```
data/records/
  scy/records.md          # Combined boys/girls
  lcm/records.md
  top10/scy/50-free.md    # Combined
  annual/2024-scy.md      # Combined
```

**After (v0.6.0):**
```
data/records/
  scy/records-boys.md     # Boys only
  scy/records-girls.md    # Girls only
  lcm/records-boys.md
  lcm/records-girls.md
  top10/scy/boys/50-free.md
  top10/scy/girls/50-free.md
  annual/2024-scy-boys.md
  annual/2024-scy-girls.md
```

### Backwards Compatibility
If Gender column is missing from data, commands automatically fall back to generating combined (legacy) records with clear messaging: `"No gender data available - generating combined records"`

## Next Steps to Consider

Future enhancements (not in v0.6.0):
- Gender-specific relay parsing (identify relay participants by gender)
- Gender validation/correction command for mismatched data
- Configuration option to force combined mode even with gender data
- Historical re-import tool to add gender to existing CSVs without full re-download

**Status:** ✅ v0.6.0 implementation complete, ready for git commit/tag/push
