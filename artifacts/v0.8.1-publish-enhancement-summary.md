**Method:** `_generate_readme()`

**Key Improvements:**

1. **Top10 Organization:**
   - Scans all top10 files and groups by boys/girls
   - Creates direct links to each event markdown file
   - Formats event names (replaces hyphens with spaces, title case)

2. **Annual Summaries Organization:**
   - Parses filenames (YYYY-course-gender.md)
   - Groups by year, then course, then gender
   - Sorts years in descending order (most recent first)
   - Cleaner labels for better readability

3. **Automatic Navigation:**
   - All sections generated automatically based on available files
   - No manual maintenance required
   - Scales to any number of events or seasons

### After v0.8.1:
- ✅ Every top10 event linked directly
- ✅ Annual summaries grouped by year
- ✅ Event names formatted naturally
- ✅ Professional, easy-to-navigate structure
- ✅ Scales automatically as new data added
