**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Version:** 0.10.0  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

---

## üéâ What Changed

Updated the `swim-data-tool init` command to support **MaxPreps high school teams** without requiring USA Swimming team codes.

---

## ‚ú® Key Improvements

### 1. Data Source Selection ‚úÖ
When you run `swim-data-tool init`, you now choose your data source:
- **Option 1:** USA Swimming (club team)
- **Option 2:** MaxPreps (high school)

### 2. MaxPreps-Specific Questions ‚úÖ
For MaxPreps teams, you're prompted for:
- School slug (from MaxPreps URL)
- State abbreviation (e.g., az)
- City name (e.g., tucson)
- Default season (e.g., 24-25)

**NO USA Swimming team code or LSC required!** üéä

### 3. Source-Specific Next Steps ‚úÖ
The completion message shows different workflows:

**MaxPreps workflow:**
1. Review configuration
2. Fetch roster (with season range support)
3. Import swimmers
4. Generate records
- **No "classify unattached" step** (MaxPreps has no unattached swims)

**USA Swimming workflow:**
1. Review configuration
2. Fetch roster
3. Import swimmers
4. **Classify unattached** ‚Üê Only for USA Swimming
5. Generate records
