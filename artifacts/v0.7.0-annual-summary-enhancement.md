    new_records.append((event_code, age_group, season_rec))
```

### Date Filtering
```python
# Season defined as Sept 1 (year-1) through Aug 31 (year)
# Example: Season 2025 = Sept 1, 2024 - Aug 31, 2025
def filter_by_season(df, season):
    df["swim_year"] = df["swim_date_parsed"].dt.year
    return df[df["swim_year"] == season]
```

### Gender Extraction
```python
# Extract from team name if present
gender_label = ""
if "Boys" in team_name or "- Boys" in team_name:
    gender_label = "Boys"
elif "Girls" in team_name or "- Girls" in team_name:
    gender_label = "Girls"
