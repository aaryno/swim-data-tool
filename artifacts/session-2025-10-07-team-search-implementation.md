# Team Search Feature Implementation Session

**Date:** 2025-10-07  
**Session Focus:** Interactive team code search via swimmer name lookup  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete - Two-step API search fully implemented and tested

---

## Session Goal

Enhance `swim-data-tool init` command to help users find USA Swimming team codes interactively instead of manually entering them.

---

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Discovered Team Code for South West Aquatic Sports

**Result:** Team code is **`SWAS`** (not "AZ SWAS")

**Verification:**
- **Team Name:** South West Aquatic Sports
- **LSC:** AZ (Arizona Swimming)
- **Test Swimmer:** Wade Olsson (PersonKey: 1685870)
- **Confirmed via:** Direct API query showing `[OrgUnit.Level4Code] = "SWAS"`

### 2. Implemented Smart Team Code Suggestion

**Location:** `src/swim_data_tool/commands/init.py`

**Feature:** `_suggest_team_code()` method
- Analyzes club name to suggest team code
- Example: "South West Aquatic Sports" ‚Üí suggests "SWS" 
- Handles common patterns (Aquatic, Swimming, etc.)
- Falls back to first significant word

**User Experience:**
```
Full club name: South West Aquatic Sports
Club abbreviation: SWAS
Suggested based on club name: SWS
USA Swimming team code (or '?' to search) (SWS):
```

### 3. Implemented Interactive Search Framework

**Location:** `src/swim_data_tool/commands/init.py`

**Feature:** `_interactive_team_search()` method
- User enters `?` when prompted for team code
- Launches swimmer name search dialogue
- Displays results in formatted table
- User selects by number (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Auto-fills team information

**UI Flow:**
```
Enter a swimmer's name from this team: zach duerkop
Searching for swimmer...

Found 1 club(s) for this swimmer

## Technical Discoveries

### USA Swimming API Datasources

**Two Separate Datasources Identified:**

1. **"USA Swimming Times Elasticube"**
   - Contains: Swim times and results
   - **Has Team Code:** `[OrgUnit.Level4Code]` ‚úÖ
   - Has Team Name: `[OrgUnit.Level4Name]`
   - Has LSC Code: `[OrgUnit.Level3Code]`
   - Has LSC Name: `[OrgUnit.Level3Name]`
   - **Best for:** Getting actual team codes

2. **"Public Person Search"**
   - Contains: Swimmer registry information
   - **No Team Code field** ‚ùå (ClubCode doesn't exist)
   - Has Club Name: `[Persons.ClubName]`
   - Has LSC Code: `[Persons.LscCode]`
   - Has PersonKey: `[Persons.PersonKey]`
   - **Best for:** Finding swimmers by name

### Working API Query Example

**Successfully retrieved team code:**

```bash
curl 'https://usaswimming.sisense.com/api/datasources/USA%20Swimming%20Times%20Elasticube/jaql' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer [TOKEN]' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "metadata": [
      {"jaql": {"title": "TeamCode", "dim": "[OrgUnit.Level4Code]", "datatype": "text"}},
      {"jaql": {"title": "PersonKey", "dim": "[UsasSwimTime.PersonKey]", "datatype": "numeric", "filter": {"equals": 1685870}}, "panel": "scope"}
    ],
    "datasource": "USA Swimming Times Elasticube",
    "count": 5
  }'
```

**Result:** Team Code = "SWAS"

---

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Complete

1. ‚úÖ Smart team code suggestion based on club name
2. ‚úÖ `?` trigger to launch search dialogue
3. ‚úÖ UI framework for displaying results and selection
4. ‚úÖ Token management (with manual refresh)
5. ‚úÖ **Two-step swimmer search fully implemented:**
   - Step 1: Find PersonKey(s) via Public Person Search
   - Step 2: Query recent swims via Times Elasticube for actual team codes
6. ‚úÖ **Integration with `swim-data-tool init` command**
7. ‚úÖ **Tested and verified:**
   - Search for "zach duerkop" returns SWAS correctly
   - Returns real team codes (not PersonKeys)
   - Handles multiple teams (SWAS + Unattached)

---

## Final Implementation

### Two-Step Search (COMPLETED)

**File:** `src/swim_data_tool/api/usa_swimming.py` lines 368-530

The implemented solution:

```python
def search_swimmer_for_team(self, swimmer_name: str) -> list[TeamInfo]:
    # STEP 1: Find PersonKey(s) by name
    # Use Public Person Search datasource
    # Filter: [Persons.FirstAndPreferredName] contains first_name
    #         [Persons.LastName] contains last_name
    # Returns: PersonKey(s)
    
    # STEP 2: Query recent swims for each PersonKey
    # Use USA Swimming Times Elasticube datasource
    # Filter: [UsasSwimTime.PersonKey] equals PersonKey
    #         [SeasonCalendar.SeasonYearDesc] = "2025 (9/1/2024 - 8/31/2025)"
    # Returns: [OrgUnit.Level4Code] = Team Code
    #         [OrgUnit.Level4Name] = Team Name
    #         [OrgUnit.Level3Code] = LSC Code
    #         [OrgUnit.Level3Name] = LSC Name
    
    # Return unique teams found
```

### Test Results ‚úÖ

**Test Swimmer:** Zach Duerkop

**Actual Results:**
```
Found 2 team(s)

Team 1:
  Team Code: SWAS
  Team Name: South West Aquatic Sports
  LSC Code:  AZ
  LSC Name:  Arizona Swimming

Team 2:
  Team Code: UN
  Team Name: Unattached
  LSC Code:  AZ
  LSC Name:  Arizona Swimming
```

‚úÖ **All Expected Results Met:**
- ‚úÖ Team Code: SWAS (not PersonKey "17")
- ‚úÖ Team Name: South West Aquatic Sports
- ‚úÖ LSC: AZ
- ‚úÖ Returns actual team codes from swim times

## Token Management

### Current Valid Token

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoiNjRhZjE4MGY5Nzg1MmIwMDJkZTU1ZDhkIiwiYXBpU2VjcmV0IjoiMzZhZmIyOWUtYTc0ZC00YWVmLWE2YmQtMDA3MzA5ZTYwZTdkIiwiYWxsb3dlZFRlbmFudHMiOlsiNjRhYzE5ZTEwZTkxNzgwMDFiYzM5YmVhIl0sInRlbmFudElkIjoiNjRhYzE5ZTEwZTkxNzgwMDFiYzM5YmVhIn0.fFw6p06oYT6cv-NbhlxHp7-_UpEueGFQaU4N0iEGGlU
```

**Location:** `src/swim_data_tool/api/usa_swimming.py` line 35

**Note:** Tokens expire frequently, requiring manual refresh from browser network tab

---

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation

1. **`src/swim_data_tool/api/usa_swimming.py`**
   - Added `search_swimmer_for_team()` method (incomplete)
   - Updated AUTH_TOKEN

2. **`src/swim_data_tool/commands/init.py`**
   - Added `_suggest_team_code()` method
   - Added `_interactive_team_search()` method  
   - Modified `_collect_team_info()` to support `?` trigger
   - Added imports: `Table` from rich.table, `TeamInfo` from api

### Test/Debug Files (scratch/)

These files should be moved to `scratch/` directory:

1. **`test_team_code_field.py`** - Verified Level4Code field exists
2. **`test_zach_search.py`** - Debug swimmer search (revealed missing ClubCode)
3. **`check_wade_teams.py`** - Query Wade Olsson's teams
4. **`debug_team_search.py`** - General API debugging

---

## API Rate Limiting Learnings

### Memory Pressure Errors

When searching for common terms (e.g., "Aquatic") across multiple years:
```
Error: SafeModeException: Safe-Mode caused Querying cancellation
Server exceeded 85 percent capacity
```

**Solution:** Limit searches to:
- Single year (2025 only)
- Specific PersonKey (after Step 1)
- Small result counts (10-50 max)

---

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Approach 1: Team Name Search (Abandoned)
- **Problem:** Searching "Aquatic" returns thousands of swims
- **Problem:** Causes API memory pressure
- **Status:** ‚ùå Not viable

### Approach 2: Public Person Search (Attempted)
- **Problem:** No ClubCode field in datasource
- **Status:** ‚ùå Insufficient data

### Approach 3: Two-Step PersonKey ‚Üí Swims (Current)
- **Benefit:** Light query (one person's recent swims)
- **Benefit:** Gets actual team code
- **Status:** üöß In progress

### Approach 4: Manual Entry with Smart Suggestion (Working Fallback)
- **Benefit:** Already works
- **Benefit:** No API dependency
- **Example:** "South West Aquatic Sports" ‚Üí suggests "SWS"
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Working fallback if search fails

---

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Test of Two-Step Approach

1. Search for PersonKey:
```bash
# Find Zach Duerkop's PersonKey
curl 'https://usaswimming.sisense.com/api/datasources/Public%20Person%20Search/jaql' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer [TOKEN]' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"metadata":[
    {"jaql":{"title":"PersonKey","dim":"[Persons.PersonKey]","datatype":"numeric"}},
    {"jaql":{"title":"FirstAndPreferredName","dim":"[Persons.FirstAndPreferredName]","datatype":"text","filter":{"contains":"zach"}},"panel":"scope"},
    {"jaql":{"title":"LastName","dim":"[Persons.LastName]","datatype":"text","filter":{"contains":"duerkop"}},"panel":"scope"}
  ],"datasource":"Public Person Search","count":10}'
```

2. Query that PersonKey's swims:
```bash
# Get team code from swims (replace PERSONKEY with result from step 1)
curl 'https://usaswimming.sisense.com/api/datasources/USA%20Swimming%20Times%20Elasticube/jaql' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer [TOKEN]' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"metadata":[
    {"jaql":{"title":"TeamCode","dim":"[OrgUnit.Level4Code]","datatype":"text"}},
    {"jaql":{"title":"TeamName","dim":"[OrgUnit.Level4Name]","datatype":"text"}},
    {"jaql":{"title":"LSC","dim":"[OrgUnit.Level3Code]","datatype":"text"}},
    {"jaql":{"title":"PersonKey","dim":"[UsasSwimTime.PersonKey]","datatype":"numeric","filter":{"equals":PERSONKEY}},"panel":"scope"}
  ],"datasource":"USA Swimming Times Elasticube","count":5}'
```

### Integration Test

After completing two-step implementation:

```bash
cd ~/swimming/south-west-aquatic-sports
swim-data-tool init "South West Aquatic Sports"

# When prompted for team code:
# Enter: ?
# Enter swimmer name: zach duerkop
# Expected: Shows SWAS team
# Select: 1
# Verify: Team code = SWAS, LSC = AZ
```

## Known Issues

1. **Terminal Output Capture:** Assistant unable to capture terminal output in this session
   - Workaround: User runs commands manually and pastes results
   
2. **Token Expiration:** API tokens expire frequently
   - Workaround: Manual refresh from browser network tab
   
3. **Python Command:** User's system uses `python3` not `python`
   - Note: pyenv manages multiple Python versions

---

## User Experience Wins

Even without search working perfectly, improvements made:

1. **Smart Suggestion:** Helps users guess team code
2. **Clear Instructions:** "Or enter team code directly (e.g., SWAS, FORD, NOVA)"
3. **Fallback Path:** Can always enter manually
4. **Known Answer:** We discovered SWAS = South West Aquatic Sports

---

## Session Completion Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed Items

1. ‚úÖ **Two-step search fully implemented** in `search_swimmer_for_team()`
2. ‚úÖ **Tested with Zach Duerkop** - verified SWAS lookup works
3. ‚úÖ **Real team codes returned** (not PersonKeys)
4. ‚úÖ **Integration working** in `swim-data-tool init` command
5. ‚úÖ **Documentation updated** in session artifacts

### üßπ Optional Cleanup Tasks (For Later)

1. Move test files to `scratch/` directory:
   - `test_team_code_field.py`
   - `test_zach_search.py`
   - `check_wade_teams.py`
   - `debug_team_search.py`
   - `test_two_step_search.py`

2. Consider bumping VERSION to 0.4.1 if releasing

3. Update README.md with feature documentation

```bash
# Initialize a new team repository
swim-data-tool init "South West Aquatic Sports"

# When prompted for team code, enter '?'
USA Swimming team code (or '?' to search): ?

# Enter a swimmer's name from the team
Enter a swimmer's name from this team: zach duerkop

# Select from the results table
Select team number, 's' to search again, or 'c' to cancel [1]: 1

# Team info is auto-filled!
