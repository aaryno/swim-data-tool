curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### Install swim-data-tool

```bash
# Clone the repository

swim-data-tool init "My Swim Team Name"
```

The init command will:
- Search for your team via USA Swimming API
- Create directory structure
- Generate configuration files (.env, README.md, claude.md)
- Set up data directories

### 2. Fetch Team Roster

```bash
# USA Swimming roster
swim-data-tool roster --source=usa_swimming

# MaxPreps roster (high school)
swim-data-tool roster --source=maxpreps --seasons=24-25

# Multiple seasons
swim-data-tool roster --source=maxpreps --start-season=20-21 --end-season=24-25
```

### 3. Import Swimmer Data

```bash
# Import all swimmers from roster
swim-data-tool import swimmers --source=usa_swimming

# Import specific swimmer by PersonKey
swim-data-tool import swimmer 123456

# Import from MaxPreps
swim-data-tool import swimmers --source=maxpreps
```

### 4. Classify Unattached Swims

```bash
# Interactive classification
swim-data-tool classify unattached

# Non-interactive with flags
swim-data-tool classify unattached \
  --high-school=exclude \
  --probationary=include \
  --college=exclude \
  --misc-unattached=exclude
```

### 5. Generate Records

swim-data-tool generate records

# Specific course
swim-data-tool generate records --course=scy

# Top 10 lists
swim-data-tool generate top10
swim-data-tool generate top10 --n=25

# Annual summary for a season
swim-data-tool generate annual --season=2024
swim-data-tool generate annual --season=2024 --course=scy
```

### 6. Publish Records

```bash

```

## Configuration

All team-specific configuration is stored in `.env` files:

```bash
# Required for USA Swimming
USA_SWIMMING_TOKEN=your_sisense_jwt_token
USA_SWIMMING_TEAM_CODE=YOUR_TEAM
LSC_CODE=XX
START_YEAR=2000
END_YEAR=2025

# Optional for MaxPreps
MAXPREPS_SCHOOL_SLUG=your-school
MAXPREPS_CITY=city
MAXPREPS_STATE=state
MAXPREPS_GENDER=boys

# Optional for publishing
PUBLIC_REPO_URL=https://github.com/yourusername/team-records
PUBLIC_REPO_PATH=/path/to/local/clone

# Team metadata
CLUB_NAME=My Swim Team
CLUB_ABBREVIATION=MST
SWIMCLOUD_TEAM_ID=12345678
```

## Development

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/aaryno/swim-data-tool.git
cd swim-data-tool

# Create virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install with dev dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=swim_data_tool --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_commands/test_init.py
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Lint with ruff
ruff check .

# Auto-fix linting issues
ruff check . --fix

# Format code
ruff format .

# Type check with mypy
mypy src/swim_data_tool
```

### CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration:
- **Lint**: Ruff linting and formatting checks
- **Type Check**: Mypy static type analysis
- **Test**: Pytest on Python 3.11 and 3.12

## Privacy & Security

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Team repositories contain personally identifiable information (PII):
- Swimmer names
- Dates of birth (in some cases)
- USA Swimming PersonKeys

**Best Practices:**
- Keep team repositories **private**
- Never commit `.env` files
- Never commit `data/raw/` directory
- Only publish aggregate records (no individual PII)
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive data

## API Token Management

### USA Swimming Token

The USA Swimming API requires a Sisense JWT token. See [docs/UPDATE_API_TOKEN.md](docs/UPDATE_API_TOKEN.md) for:
- How to obtain a token
- Token validation
- Troubleshooting expired tokens

## Use Cases

### Club Teams (USA Swimming)
- Track team records across age groups
- Generate top 10 all-time performer lists
- Classify unattached swims for eligibility
- Publish records to public websites

### High School Teams (MaxPreps)
- Collect data from MaxPreps team pages
- Generate grade-based records
- Track season-by-season progression
- Create annual summaries with records broken

### Multi-Team Organizations
- Manage multiple team repositories
- Compare performance across teams
- Aggregate data for LSC or district analysis
